## Project Description

This work day scheduler uses JQuery to dynamically create elements - the time, the input field, the save button - all are dynamically generated! It saves user input locally, user input is persistent.

## Project Criteria

WHEN I open the planner, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar ✔

WHEN I scroll down, I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours ✔

WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day, each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future ✔

WHEN I click into a timeblock, I can enter an event ✔

WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock, the text for that event is saved in local storage ✔

WHEN I refresh the page, the saved events persist ✔

## Design Notes

There are many modifications to Bootstrap that I forgot to note along the way, my apologies!
